# Lattice and DistributiveLattice trait

The `Lattice` trait and related traits in the `ring` module are used to define `join` and `meet` behaviors on values within a `PathMap`.  So two values at the same path may interact with each other as part of these operations.

WARNING: This mechanism is planned for rework, to allow a "policy" to be provided instead of forcing a `Lattice` implementation to be associated to the value type.  Therefore the current behaviors will not be explained further.
