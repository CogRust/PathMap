# Modifying the Space
The [`ZipperWriting`] trait provides methods to modify the trie structure and values. This trait provides comprehensive functionality for creating, updating, and removing data within the trie.

## Direct Value Access
- [`get_val_mut`] returns a mutable reference to the value at the focus, or `None` if no value exists
- [`set_val`] sets the value at the focus, returning any previously existing value
- [`remove_val`] removes the value at the focus, optionally pruning dangling paths

## Upsert Value Access (Create-Or-Update)
- [`get_val_or_set_mut`] returns a mutable reference to the value at the focus, inserting the provided default if no value exists
- [`get_val_or_set_mut_with`] similar to above, but uses a closure to generate the default value when needed

## Path Creation and Removal
- [`create_path`] ensures a path exists to the current focus, creating intermediate nodes as needed
- [`prune_path`] removes dangling path segments above the focus that have no values or branches
- [`prune_ascend`] combines pruning with ascension, moving to the first non-dangling path

## Subtrie Shifting
- [`insert_prefix`] adds a prefix to all downstream paths from the focus
- [`remove_prefix`] removes the specified number of bytes from paths above the focus

## Subtrie Moving and Copying
- [`graft`] replaces the subtrie below the focus with content from another zipper's focus
- [`graft_map`] replaces the subtrie below the focus with the contents of a [`PathMap`]
- [`take_map`] extracts the subtrie below the focus into a new [`PathMap`], removing it from the original

## Branch Removal
- [`remove_branches`] removes all child branches below the focus
- [`remove_unmasked_branches`] selectively removes branches based on a byte mask

## Pruning Behavior
Many operations accept a `prune` parameter that controls whether dangling paths should be automatically cleaned up. When `prune` is `true`, the operation will remove any path segments that become empty, aka "dangling" (no values, and no further downstream branches) as a result of the modification.

Automatic pruning helps maintain a compact trie structure by removing unnecessary nodes, but can be counter-productive when you plan to perform additional operations that might reuse those paths.
