# Algebraic Operations on Whole Maps

[PathMap] supports efficient operations to modify maps or construct new maps, using existing maps as operands.  From these primitive operations, it is possible to construct and evaluate complex queries over data represented in a `PathMap`.  For an example, see the [Aunt Knowledge Graph]((GOAT, fix this link)) example section.

## Join (Union)

`join` creates the union of multiple trees, so a path present in *any* operand will be present in the result

#### Example

```rust
GOAT example code
```

operand_0:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
```

operand_1:
```txt
movies:casablanca
movies:star_wars
```

result:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
movies:casablanca
movies:star_wars
```

## Meet (Intersection)

`meet` intersects multiple trees, so a path present in *all* operands will be present in the result

#### Example

```rust
GOAT example code
```

operand_0:
```txt
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
movies:casablanca
```

operand_1:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
movies:casablanca
movies:star_wars
```

result:
```txt
books:great_gatsby,the
movies:casablanca
```

## Subtract

`subtract` removes all paths in one tree from another, so a path present in the `lvalue` tree that is not present in the `rvalue` tree will be present in the result.  Conceptually, `subtract` acts like a `meet` between the `lvalue` and the inverse of the `rvalue` - although currently there is no inverse operation for `PathMap`.

#### Example

```rust
GOAT example code
```

lvalue:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
movies:casablanca
movies:star_wars
```

rvalue:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:moby_dick
movies:star_wars
```

result:
```txt
books:great_gatsby,the
movies:casablanca
```

## Restrict

`restrict` removes paths from one tree that do not have a corresponding prefix in another tree.  You can conceptualize `restrict` as a generalization of `meet`, where every path in the `rvalue` ends in a "wildcard".

#### Example

```rust
GOAT example code
```

lvalue:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
movies:casablanca
movies:star_wars
```

rvalue:
```txt
books
```

result:
```
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
```

## Join K Path, aka Drop Head

`join_k_path` collapses `n` bytes from all paths, joining together the subtrees as it proceeds.

#### Example

```rust
GOAT example code
```

lvalue:
```txt
books:don_quixote
books:great_gatsby,the
books:moby_dick
```

result of `join_k_path(6)`:
```
don_quixote
great_gatsby,the
moby_dick
```
