# Algebra on Subtries
The [`ZipperWriting`] trait includes algebraic operations that operate on subtries below a zipper's focus.

These methods provide the same fundamental operations as the whole-map operations described in [Algebraic Operations on Whole Maps](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md), but applied to specific subtries within a larger trie structure.  This enables surgical modification of specific portions of large data structures, while leaving the rest of the structure intact.

## Join Operations
- [`join_into`] performs a [join](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md#join-union) on the subtrie at the current focus with a subtrie from another zipper
- [`join_map`] joins a [`PathMap`] into the current subtrie, consuming the map
- [`join_into_take`] joins and consumes the source subtrie from another write zipper
- [`join_k_path_into`] performs [join_k_path](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md#join-k-path-aka-drop-head) operation on the current subtrie

## Meet Operations
- [`meet_into`] performs a [meet](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md#meet-intersection) on the subtrie at the current focus with a subtrie from another zipper
- [`meet_2`] experimental operation that meets the current subtrie with two other subtries simultaneously

## Subtract Operations
- [`subtract_into`] performs [subtract](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md#subtract) on the subtrie at the current focus, subtracting a subtrie from another zipper

## Restrict Operations
- [`restrict`] performs [restrict](./1.01.00_algebraic_ops.md#restrict) on the subtrie at the current focus using a subtrie from another zipper
- [`restricting`] populates "stem" paths in the current subtrie with corresponding subtries from the source
