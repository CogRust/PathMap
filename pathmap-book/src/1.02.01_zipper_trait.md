# The Base Zipper Trait
The [`Zipper`] trait forms the foundation of all zipper types in PathMap. It provides the minimal interface needed to inspect the structure of the space / trie at the zipper's focus.  It is implemented on all zipper types.

The base trait defines three essential types of operations which are fundamental to all spaces / pathmap tries:

## Path Existence
The [`path_exists`] method returns whether the zipper's focus is positioned on a valid path within the trie. This is fundamental since zippers can be positioned on non-existent paths - locations that could potentially hold data but currently don't.

## Value Presence
The [`is_val`] method indicates whether there is a value stored at the current focus position. Note that a path can exist in the trie structure without necessarily having a value - the trie may continue deeper from this point.

## Child Branches
Two methods provide information about the trie structure below the current focus:
- [`child_count`] returns the number of child branches extending from the current node
- [`child_mask`] returns a 256-bit mask indicating exactly which byte values have corresponding child branches, and it the caller to determine the next byte in all existing downstream paths.
